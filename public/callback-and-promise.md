# Callback and Promises

## Callback

Callback is a function which is passed as an argument to another function.

## Promise 

The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

###  Promise is a placeholder for future value.

### The result of a promise can be a successful value or error.

### Promise will be in one of the three states

1. pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
2. fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
3. rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
